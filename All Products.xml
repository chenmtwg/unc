 Chapoutier's roots in the Rhône date back to 1808, when the family 
first settled in Tain l'Hermitage. The family purchased a winery owned 
by Comte Monier de la Sizeranne and over time, acquired a number of 
excellent vineyards, including some of the oldest in France.  M. 
Chapoutier was the first winery to put Braille on a wine label in 1996. 
Far from being anecdotic, this symbol draws its origin from the very 
history of the Hermitage vineyard. Maurice Monier de la Sizeranne, owner
 of the plot of the Hermitage, la Sizeranne, is also the inventor of the
 first version of abbreviated Braille.</p>

Chapoutier is one of the most highly regarded winemakers in France and 
since taking over his family firm in 1990 at the age of 26, he has 
transformed the winery into the leading Rhône producer. The highly 
sought-after appellation of Hermitage is named after the tiny chapel at 
its highest point (once home to hermits). Most do not realize Hermitage 
is comprised of just a few hilltops with very dense terroir. Steep 
southerly facing terraces with unique microclimates drive rich 
complexity in the wines. In Hermitage, Syrah achieves its noblest

 is one of the world’s best known dry white wines.  This Chablis Premier
 Cru is produced only from fruit harvested from Premier Cru vineyards - a
 unique blend from a number of superb sites.  This is Chardonnay in its 
purest form. It is not barrel aged, but is bottled early to retain 
freshness and purity. Smooth, refreshing and pure, this is the perfect 
wine to enjoy year-round.

Pale straw color tinged through with green and fading to a water white 
rim.  Fresh and clean on the nose with zesty lemon fruit, chalk, 
minerals and oyster water with notes of gooseberry and lime.  Lovely 
mouthfeel and structure with a terrific acidity around which the rest of
 the wine sits very nicely. A hint of richness on the mid-palate which 
balances well with the citrus and mineral elements. Long and refreshing 
to the finish and exceptionally pure throughout.

Enjoy with lobster or oysters for an elegant meal.</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/mischief-and-mayhem-meursault-2006.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Mischief and Mayhem Meursault 2006</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent">One
 of the great Chardonnay vineyards of the world, Meursault at its best 
should be full, rich, round and complex with elements of cream, butter, 
nuts and ripe citrus fruit. The Mischief and Mayhem Meursault generally 
gets about 12 months in barrel, a period of time which mellows and 
softens the wine yet also adds a further dimension of weight and 
complexity. This is a rich wine, yet one which remains clean and firm on
 account of its excellent acidic structure – although easy to drink and 
enjoy when young, this is a great example of just how complex and fine 
Chardonnay can be.

Honey gold in color, shining bright and tinged through with green. 
Intense, powerful nose, rich, layered and complex with notes of pear, 
orange oil, baked apple and ground ginger spice, with traces of green 
peppercorn and butter. 

Beautifully clean on the palate. Lean, pure and mineral with an intense,
 beautifully structured acidic profile around which the wine wraps 
itself. Great complexity of fruit with lovely notes of grapefruit, pear,

of the most important periods goes back to the time when the Popes had 
their residence in Avignon in the 15th Century. The village of 
Châteauneuf-du-Pape was at that time the papal summer residence (Jean 
XXII, Urban V and Innocent VI), and they succeeded in imposing its 
wines. In the early 20th Century, winegrowers were regularly 
acknowledged for their wines by a special board of judges which was set 
up under the instigation of Baron "le Roy de Boiseaumarié."

 Terlato, a leader in the wine industry for over 50 years, is a

cellaring those wines since the early 50s. When he began producing his

 Bordeaux wines with a special selection of varietal blends. And thus 
the “Peak Series” of wines of Napa Valley Bordeaux blends were born to 
honor some grand crus of Bordeaux. Angels’ Peak is the first blend in 
the series, following the traditions and methods of the Pomerol region 
which is known for its fruit forward wines dominated by the Merlot 
grape. This wine is a rich, lush tribute to Pomerol.

 The son of a welder, Mike Ditka was a three-sport start at Aliquippa 
High in Western Pennsylvania. At the University of Pittsburgh he won 
All-American honors. Rookie of the Year, All-NFL four times and a 
perennial Pro Bowl selection, he played for champions in Chicago and 
Dallas in the National Football League where he revolutionized the tight
 end position. Coach Ditka's drive for excellence on the field led him 
to build on his passion for wine and create a portfolio of wines to 
partner with a variety of foods. The 2011 “The Player” Pinot Grigio is 
crisp and refreshing, and will pair wonderfully with shellfish or 
chicken.</p></div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/mike-ditka-the-hall-of-famer-chardonnay-2011.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Mike Ditka "The Hall of Famer" Chardonnay 2011</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent"><p xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts"><span><strong>The Hall of Famer.</strong></span>In
 1998 Mike Ditka became the first tight end to make the Pro Football

have talent, but talent in itself is no accomplishment.  Excellence in 
football and excellence in life is bred when men recognize their 
opportunities and then pursue them with a passion."

Coach Ditka's passion for wine inspired him to create a portfolio of 
wines to partner with a variety of foods. The 2010 “The Hall of Famer”

 Clos Apalta is a hand-crafted red blend that is uniquely Chilean in its
 terroir and use of Carmenére as the base. The grapes are grown in 
Lapostolle's Apalta vineyard which has an exceptional semi-arid climate,
 different from the rest of Colchagua Valley. Coastal mountains, which 
partially block the cold influence of the Pacific Ocean, keep the 
growing season days long and dry, while allowing for the nights to cool 
things down.</p>
<p xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">The 
result is a unique and multi-layered wine with deep inky purple red 
color. Young aromas at first, but opening toward ripe and expressive red
 fruit, such as plums, red cherries and dry figs with notes of mocha and
 sweet spicy hints of vanilla and clover. This wine is concentrated in 
structure with a round, packed attack preceding a punch of velvety and 
polished tannins that fill the mid-palate and followed by a ripe and 
rich, long lasting finish. This signature wine for Lapostolle reflects 
their exacting quality standards and their philosophy to express the 
terrior while respecting the earth. Perfect to enjoy now but also has 
great aging potential.</p>

The wines from Kracher's Weinlaubenhof have long been in a class of

level of recognition worldwide and only a few have come close to the

This wine is medium golden yellow in color with fine floral notes,

Kracher Beerenauslese Cuvée is yellow green in color with fine nuances

Elios Mediterranean Red is a rich blend of the classic Greek grape 
Agiorgitiko along with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.   The wine is a 
deep red color with purple hues and blackberry, plum and chocolate 
aromas abound. Rich on the palate with soft, round tannins and bit of 
spiciness on the finish.

A great summer wine for picnics or backyard BBQs!</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/two-hands-wines-brilliant-disguise-2012.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Two Hands Wines Brilliant Disguise 2012</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent">This
 light fresh wine is made from 30 to 50 year old White Frontignac 
(Muscat) vines grown in the Barossa Valley.  It is always the first 
variety to be picked and the first wine to be bottled from a vintage.  
It is pressed, fermented, filtered and bottled in quick succession.  The
 essence of the Moscato style is in maintaining freshness.

Light straw in color, this wine has a very lively bouquet of lemon zest,
 pineapple, lychee, guava, persimmons, tropical fruit juice and fresh 
sherbet. The palate is sweet and thick and then gains energy as the 
bubbles and acidity give life to the thick layer of fruit along the 
palate. The finish is very clean and there is a lovely density and 
purity which is rarely found in top flight Moscato.</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/vive-la-france-twelve.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Chapoutier Entertaining</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent"><p xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Perfect

 Els is known as "The Big Easy" due to his imposing height along with 
his fluid golf swing. This wine, made by cellar master Louis Strydom, 
reflects the same bold, balanced and winning nature all at a great

Aromas of black fruits, Christmas cake, liquorice and cinnamon tempt 
your nose. With a dense and full-bodied palate, purple color, spice 
abounds from the dominant Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon adds punchy 
tannins and a robust structure. Floral and savoury notes from Mourvedre,
 Cinsaut and Vigonier all contribute to the exotic rhythm of the Big

transported to the winery in temperature-controlled containers. Strict 
quality control is maintained with hand de-stemming for some lots. The 
rest of the grapes are chosen via a state of the art optical berry 
selector, Vistalys, which ensures that only the freshest, cleanest and 
purest grapes are used to produce our wines. No stabilization, no

true expressions of their origin.

 Valley fruit. Made with a focus on quality from select fruit that meets
 the highest standards, EPISODE stands out as truly elegant wine—a 
classic. EPISODE is crafted in limited quantities, a mere 17 barrels in 
2009, a vintage with offered distinctive fruit with incredible aging 
potential.

This vintage is exceptional with aromas of blackberry, black currant and
 nutmeg with a hint of vanilla.  Beautiful flavor intensity, with rich 
layers of black fruits and dark chocolate accented by notes of anise and
 licorice. This wine is mouth filling and robust, with silky tannins 
further enhancing the wine's complex expression. Great structure and 
depth with excellent aging potential of 8 years or more.  Rated 95 
points by Wine Enthusiast!</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/the-lucky-country-shiraz-2012.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">The Lucky Country Shiraz 2012</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent">Packaged
 with unique Australian imagery, The Lucky Country wines capture the 
essence, fresh-faced beauty and lively spirit that earned Australia its 
“Lucky Country” nickname.

Lucky Country Shiraz is made in a simple, natural fashion, with 
individual parcels of fruit fermented, pressed and barreled separately 
until blending just prior to bottling. Minimally fined and unfiltered, 
the wine starts out layered and concentrated, then reveals a much softer
 side on the finish

Initially full of dark fruits and chocolate/mocha notes, but upon a 
second look, aromas of grilled meats, vanilla bean and spice become 
quite prevalent.   This wine shows lovely mouth feel, density and 
control; it starts out layered and concentrated but reveals a much 
softer side of the finish.

Escape and enjoy a taste of the good life.</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/terlato-family-vineyards-syrah-2008.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Terlato Family Vineyards Syrah 2008</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent">Terlato

 Huarpe, the indigenous language of the people in Mendoza, TAMARÍ means 
“To Be Passionate”, and Tamarí is wine you can truly be passionate 
about.

Tamarí Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon is produced from estate-grown grapes 
from the high altitude Uco Valley lands of Mendoza, Argentina. The 
vineyard is located at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,100 meters above sea 
level and the soil is of alluvial origin (sand, lime, clay and stones) 
which makes it fast draining and ideal for grape growing. The vineyard 
has strong sun exposure during the day and cold temperatures at night, 
with a gentle constant breeze. These conditions are ideal for the 
Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to mature slowly for a deeper, more 
concentrated flavor.

Tamarí Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon is a seductive and velvety deep red 
wine with flowery notes of violets, jasmine, and ripe red fruits with 
intense and spicy hints of pepper and cloves. Aging in oak barrels 
provide complexity and notes of hazelnuts, almonds and vanilla.  
Excellent acidity and structure with soft, round tannins and a ripe 
fruit aftertaste.

 Oaks Napa Merlot pays tribute to the majestic native oak trees of

the land where the grapes are grown. Every bottle of Tangley Oaks wine

different parcels in the vineyards and blended into lots. The 
wine-making team tastes through each lot, carefully assessing the fruit,
 balance and tannins. Only when they fully agree on the one lot that 
best represents the varietal, appellation and vintage is the lot number

This Napa Valley Lot #7 Merlot is well balanced, showing its terroir as

 Els' life has mirrored a passion for excellence, which has been clearly
 reflected in his exceptional sporting achievements. His focus, 
discipline and commitment have been the foundation of his success, and 
these factors are evident in his quest to produce premium wine. The 
intention from the outset was to focus on delivering a quality product 
that could hold its own in the company of the world’s finest wines. This
 is clearly exemplified in this Stellenbosch Cabernet.

Deep ruby color. Pure-fruited cassis on the nose open to a fine balance 
of dark chocolate, wet earth, delicate spice and dried herbs. The palate
 has a dark inky intensity punched by a core of mineral finesse and all 
wrapped by a broad-shouldered finish. The tannins are burly and taught. A
 serious yet sumptuous wine.</div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="http://www.devuncorked.com/taste-the-book.html"><span xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">"Taste - A Life In Wine" Book by Anthony Terlato</span></a><div class="lastUpdated">Friday, August 15, 2014 10:24 AM</div></h3><div xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts" class="feedEntryContent">Take

 Vineyard Selection Malbec is harvested from historic lots in the Catena
 family’s high-altitude vineyards in the Uco Valley. 

Javier Catena and his father, Jorge, are very close to the people that 
work in the family vineyards and know the hard work that goes into 
taking good care of the vines, withstanding temperatures over 100ºF in 
the summer and below freezing in the winter.  To honor these faithful 
people, Javier named this wine after Chento, a vineyard worker and 
guardian of one of the family vineyards for more than 30 years. 

The Chento Malbec has a profoundly dark and brooding violet color. On 
the nose, Chento bursts forth with aromas of black fruits, violets and 
spices, followed by delicate mineral and graphite notes. This wine has 
intense flavors of ripe plum and chocolate, with great concentration, 
velvety tannins and a persistent finish.  This wine pairs wonderfully

 Federalist Dry Creek estate-grown Zinfandel is hand-crafted to bring 
out the true individuality of the Zinfandel grape. The Dry Creek Valley 
has unique characteristics that make it especially well-suited for 
cultivation of this hearty, decidedly American grape. The valley 
receives pronounced afternoon heat, but the vines are also cooled by the
 night air that creeps up the Russian River Valley from the waters of 
the Pacific Ocean, producing evening and early morning fog.  These 
vineyards enjoy extended “hang time,” which produces more mature fruit, 
and results in rich, full-bodied flavor characteristics.

The Federalist Zinfandel has robust fruit with bright berry fruit

 Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay is sourced exclusively from two estate 
vineyards in the heart of this cool climate appellation. This hand 
harvested, barrel fermented Chardonnay features intriguing aromas of 
lemon peel, apricot, toasted hazelnut and white flowers.  In addition to
 the bright fruit this wine has a very pleasant minerality and acidity 
which give it great structure, and carries through with a long finish.  A
 balanced, full-bodied wine, it is wonderful complement to most seafood,
 poultry dishes, and pasta with lighter sauces.  It also makes an 
excellent pairing with mushrooms (especially chanterelles and morels).

 Chapoutier's roots in the Rhône date back to 1808, when the family 
first settled in Tain l'Hermitage. The family purchased a winery owned 
by Comte Monier de la Sizeranne and over time, acquired a number of 
excellent vineyards, including some of the oldest in France.  M. 
Chapoutier was the first winery to put Braille on a wine label in 1996. 
Far from being anecdotic, this symbol draws its origin from the very 
history of the Hermitage vineyard. Maurice Monier de la Sizeranne, owner
 of the plot of the Hermitage, la Sizeranne, is also the inventor of the
 first version of abbreviated Braille.</p>

Chapoutier is one of the most highly regarded winemakers in France and 
since taking over his family firm in 1990 at the age of 26, he has 
transformed the winery into the leading Rhône producer. The highly 
sought-after appellation of Hermitage is named after the tiny chapel at 
its highest point (once home to hermits). Most do not realize Hermitage 
is comprised of just a few hilltops with very dense terroir. Steep 
southerly facing terraces with unique microclimates drive rich 
complexity in the wines. In Hermitage, Syrah achieves its noblest

The Nino Franco Prosecco Riva San Flor 2012 has a bright, brilliant 
straw-color. The aroma is very fruity (pear, apple, banana) and flower

2.0 hectares (4.9 acres) characterized by stony soil of limestone, clay

regular battonage (stirring of the lees in the barrel) have produced 
very pure white wines well-balanced with fantastic acidity.

 neighbor. The only difference is the East exposure of the "Caradeux" 
which makes this plot an exceptional "terroir" providing unique mineral 
characteristics. After a very cold winter and a demanding Spring, the 
hot summer was regularly interrupted by rainy intervals which in early 
September gave way to bright and warm weather, which sped up the 
maturation of the grapes. Harvest began in the last days of September 
under a bright sunshine. Meticulous vinifications and aging have enabled
 the taming of the vibrant acidity of the white wines.

 is one of the world’s leading producers of Chardonnay. While it is 
grown all over the state, this grape truly comes alive in the 
lesser-known wine region of Santa Barbara County in the Central Coast. 
Santa Barbara County has a rich winemaking tradition dating back to the 
18th century when Spanish missionaries planted the first grapes to make 
sacramental wine for Mission Santa Barbara.</p>
<p xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">One of 
the most charming Chardonnays to be found in Santa Barbara County is 
Flor de Campo from Sanford Winery. Flor de Campo is Spanish for 
wildflower and was inspired by the beautiful wildflowers that cover the 
hillsides throughout the region and now grace the label of this 
wonderful wine.</p>
<p xml:base="http://www.devuncorked.com/rss/catalog/allproducts">Flor de
 Campo Chardonnay is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity and hints of 
minerality thanks to “whole cluster pressing” of the grapes that helps 
preserve the bright fruit flavors. A combination of both stainless steel
 and oak barrel fementation provide a medium bodied texture and a 
pleasing lingering fruit finish. Chardonnay is the perfect summer wine 
and pairs beautifully with shellfish, fresh salads, grilled fish, 
roasted chicken or seafood pasta. Serve it at a picnic or summer supper
